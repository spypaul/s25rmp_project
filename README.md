Mesh files are large and not version controlled.  You can download them [here](https://sumailsyr-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/gkatz01_syr_edu/EUKWyYSia3ZIm-fT52mZBVsBUEYFgXxSADCDQQiRCSegBw?e=KGUUel) (you'll need to be logged into your SU OneDrive account for access).  Then extract the zip archive into a sub-directory of this repository named "meshes".

You also need to install the [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) simulator.

Once PyBullet is installed and the meshes are extracted in the correct location, you can visualize the simulation environment.  Run this command from within the top-level folder of the repository:

`python simulation.py`
